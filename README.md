# Better Kol

The Kol (as of this writing) deals 67 DPS. _Fusillade_ grants +10% for 25 seconds for 10 more antimatter than Experimental Beam. That makes it...

- less than half as efficient (5.33 DPA vs 1.97 DPA on a _very_ thirsty ship)
- it takes 5 times longer to deliver that damage
- you'll never actually see all DPS because not every weapon bank is always live
- ability damage bypasses armor and shield mitigation while weapons don't

Adaptive Force Field meanwhile is useful _eventually_, but starts out clearly subpar.

## Changes

- Improved the DPS of Fusillade to be on par with Experimental Beam.
    - Cooldown Rate: 10%/20%/30%/40% => 30%/40%/50%/60%
    - Fusillade now grants 10/20/30/40 armor penetration
- Improves the floor of AFF to be useful earlier.
